At 100 HP, we felt Frost Mats were sometimes too hard to destroy, and we want cautious players to be rewarded accordingly.\nKaid\n\nSwapping Kaid\u2019s barbed wire for Nitro Cell.\n\nWe are replacing Kaid\u2019s barbed wire for the Nitro Cell after reviewing Kaid\u2019s performance and player feedback. By adding the C4 to his loadout, we hope to make him more versatile and to up his pickrate.\nPulse\n\nDecreased to Pulses Cardiac Sensor unequipping time to 0.65s (down from 0.8s)\n\nBy increasing the swap speed of Pulse\u2019s gadget, we are trying to make Pulse\u2019s gadget a bit more appealing and comfortable to use during a round. Following community feedback on the change over the course of the TS, we feel 0.65 is a good middle ground.\nTwitch\n\nF2 assault rifle recoil increased.\n\nWe have increased the recoil of the F2 assault rifle. As an Operator with one of the highest performance and pick rates, having one of the most powerful weapons in her hands made her a bit too powerful. To address this, we\u2019ve increased the recoil of the Famas based on feedback and will continue monitoring for future changes.\nSound propagation changes\nWe have been continuously working to gradually improve sound propagation in game and on our maps. With this Y4S2 update we\u2019ve made global improvements to sound propagation in order to address inconsistent results when interacting with reinforcements.\n\nFixed inconsistent propagation obstruction on partially reinforced walls.\nFixed inconsistent propagation on reinforced tall walls with a destroyable upper half where sound would not pass.\nWith this fix we're aware that an issue still exists where sound will propagate over broken walls even when the wall is reinforced. We will continue working to address it in a future update.\n\nChanges to UbiClub Challenges\nWith the start of the new season, Ubisoft Club Challenges will now run on a Thursday > Thursday schedule.\nExploits\nWe are continuing to work to address the exploits involving Clash, Claymores, and Deployable Shields. The final fix should be deployed during the season. In the meantime, we will be pushing a partial fix and additional fail-safes that will allow us to re-enable Clash, deployable shields, and claymores. The goal of these failsafes is to make sure that the glitches cannot be exploited even in the chance that they are replicated.\n\nClash: Added a failsafe that resets them back to normal if they achieve the glitch.\nIQ: Added a failsafe that turns her visible if she manages to go invisible.\nDeployable shields: Added a failsafe that will not allow players to shoot if they glitch, and the shield will be automatically deployed on the ground after 2 seconds.\n\nWe are also temporarily changing Warden and N\u00f8kk\u2019s secondary gadget loadouts to minimize potential issues.\n\nWarden: Replace 1x Deployable Shield with 2x Impact Grenades\nN\u00f8kk: Replace 1x Claymore with 3x Stun Grenades\n\nThis change will be in place with the start of the season. We will restore their original loadouts during Season 2 once our complete fix is deployed.\nPlayer Experience\nTo provide more readability on defuser assignment, in casual bomb game modes the defuser icon now shows up next to who the defuser is assigned to on the ready screen. If the assigned player leaves during prep phase and the defuser is reassigned, the icon will still be visible on newly assigned player.\nBUG FIXES\nGAMEPLAY\n\nFixed - Players can vault onto windowsills via a deployable shield.\nFixed - Audio for drone movement sounds sometimes are not played for 3rd parties after being idle for a few moments.\nFixed - Breach charge deployment audio does not play if the breach charge is at max range.\nFixed - Placing a gadget after rappelling in can cause rubberbanding.\nFixed - L/R camera sweeps in 1st person while performing an action will trigger an instant orientation\nFixed - Operators can fall through the map or remain stuck when rappelling too closely to a structure.\nFixed - Moving around in prone stance while leaning makes no sound.\nFixed - User loses controls of their drone if it is the last to get destroyed during the preparation phase.\n\nOPERATORS\nBlackbeard\n\nFixed - Blackbeard run speed does not decrease when his rifle shield is equipped.\nFixed - When player rappels with Rifle-Shield, the head is misplaced in third-person view compared to first-person view.\n\nCapitao\n\nFixed - Fire from Capitao's bolts will fail to propagate if dart is shot at side of beams of destroyed floors/ceilings.\n\nGlaz\n\nFixed - EOR replay + killcam doesn't mirror Glaz scope effect intensity during the kill.\nFixed - After ADSing repeatedly, Glaz light intensity indicators on his scope can sometimes be white in color.\nFixed - Glaz's Thermal scope in support mode stays at 100% vision regardless of Glaz's motion;

More accurate reports from you and other players, means we can make sure we're handing out the appropriate sanctions to players that deserve it.\n\nAccess the Report options via the Player Profile Panel. Each report type has a description to help you choose the most appropriate report type. Once the report is made, you'll receive a confirmation message that we received the report . Players can only be reported once per match per player.\nBUG FIXES\nGAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED \u2013 Issues with launching when AntiVirus protection is on.\nFIXED \u2013 Gadget does not always properly deploy if the button is released right before completion.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN\n\nFIXED \u2013 Various clipping issues on maps.\nFIXED \u2013 Various visual texture issues on maps.\nFIXED \u2013 Various issues with vegetation on maps.\nFIXED \u2013 Echo's Yokai can hide in certain spots on Bank due to missing collision with map assets.\nFIXED \u2013 Uneven floor in Coastline.\nFIXED \u2013 Defenders are not detected as being 'Outside' when in the window frame of 2F Control Room on Theme Park.\nFIXED \u2013 Missing compass location on minimap on Tower.\nFIXED \u2013 Some lower sections of soft walls on Kafe can act as unbreakable surfaces.\nFIXED \u2013 Unbreakable sign in 1F Office Hallway of Bank.\nFIXED \u2013 Gadgets can be deployed in out of reach areas in 2F Control Room on Theme Park.\nFIXED \u2013 Defuser can't be picked up after being dropped in the fountain in EXT Fountain on Villa.\nFIXED \u2013 Ace's SELMA can get stuck on the cupboard of 1F Kitchen on Oregon and become unrecoverable.\nFIXED \u2013 Attackers can be spawn killed from EXT Warehouse on Cluhouse.\nFIXED \u2013 Gadgets can be deployed in out of reach areas in 2F Cash Room on Clubhouse.\nFIXED \u2013 Attackers can be spawn killed at EXT Warehouse.\nFIXED \u2013 Drones can clip through the furniture in 3F Bathroom on Yacht.\n\nUSER EXPERIENCE\n\nFIXED \u2013 Various Menu/UI issues.\nFIXED \u2013 Various visual cosmetic issues.\nFIXED \u2013 Various cosmetic clipping issues.\n", "5.2.3": "Y5S2.3 will release the week of July 27th for both PC and Console.

For the full Shadow Legacy Patch Notes, follow the link below.\n\n\nUPDATES\nPING 2.0\nWe\u2019re currently evaluating the feedback that we\u2019ve received on Ping 2.0 over the course of the Test Server. So far, we've observed that the benefits of the new ping system are more heavily weighted towards more casual players, but we also understand the potential drawbacks raised by high-tier players about the new ping system.  With this in mind, we would like to spend some more time gathering data and feedback on the live servers. We'll continue closely monitoring the impact of Ping 2.0 while it's on live while we we take a closer look at our options to try and will do our best to incorporate feedback to make the new Ping 2.0 an enjoyable experience and useful tool for players of all backgrounds.\nOPTICS\n1x Scope Options and Availability\nWe have heard player feedback on the availability of options for 1x scopes on operators. While making the 1x scopes available for all the operators is something that we have considered, there are a number of design limitations that prevent us from making it a possibility at this time. We are currently exploring our options and will share more when we have a better solution.\nScope Additions\n\n1.5x on Mozzie's P10 Roni\n1.5x on Alibi's ACS12\n2.0x on Maestro's ACS12\n2.5x on Hibana's Type-89\n\nHolo\nBased on feedback over the course of the TS, we\u2019ve given the old Holo back to some operators, while swapping the new Holo to others to gather more data and feedback. This change should give players more agency when choosing between using the new Holo vs. other alternatives. This will also only impact DEF operators with 1x zoom scopes. We'll be closely studying and monitoring the performance of the two Holos and player feedback on the live servers as well.\n\nRe-added old Nato Holo in place of the new MH1 Holo for: Wamai (AUG A2), Oryx (Mp5), Pulse (Ump 45)\nAdded new Nato Holo to replace old Holo for: Castle (Ump45), Doc (Mp5), Echo (Mp5SD)\n\nNomad\nGave Nomad more options on her scopes to make them feel and look a bit better.\n\nARX: Removed 1.5x, Added 2.0x\nAK: Removed 2.0x, Added 1.5x and 2.5x\n\nADS SENSITIVITY\nThe sensitivity slider now goes up to 200. Don\u2019t forget that when you patch into the new season, your old sensitivity settings will automatically be converted into the new system.\nIf you want to calculate  your own conversions, check out our sensitivity guide.\nBOMB REMODEL\n\nAddition of panels to the bomb model in order to fix issues with pixel peeks.\nPLAYER BEHAVIOR\nMMR Changes for Anti-Boosting\nTo discourage boosting and de-ranking, players can no longer drop below 1000 MMR, and players cannot gain more than 150 MMR from any game.\nVote-To-Kick Removal (Later in the season)\nEarly in the season, we will be removing the vote-to-kick feature from Quick Match. We've been monitoring the use of vote-to-kick for the last seasons and have confirmed that it is indeed a highly abused feature used as a disruption tool and that it is considered by most to be a pain point in this playlist. Considering that it brings more tension to Quick Match, we decided to turn it off.\nIn-Game Report Notifications\nYou will now receive in-game notifications after a player you reported is sanctioned. These will replace the \u2018Thank you\u2019 emails that used to be sent out in this scenario. We are replacing the emails with notifications to be more transparent about our sanction process. It also allows us to keep sanction communication in-game, making it easier for users to get updates while they play.\nOTHER UPDATES\n\nAdded raiser to the 1.5x Scope to alleviate the issue of the visible iron sight/front pins when in ADS.\nIana's Holograms will no longer trigger metal detectors.\nNew naming convention for shields. All shields will now display 'SHIELD' as their weapon type. (ex: Le Roc Shield, G-52 Tactical Shield, CCE Shield).\nReduced the size of the 1.5x Scope\nReduced the size of the reticule for the MH1 Holo Sight\nMinor visual tweaks to Zero's scope icons for aesthetics.\nUpdated reticle structure for Kali's CSRX300 and Capitao's Crossbow\nUpdated reticle when entering gadget mode for Kali.\nVault prompt consistency after meleeing a barricade (See Vault Detection changes). Previously you could sometimes vault barricades after 1 melee. Barricades will now require at least 2 melee hits before the vault prompt will appear.\n\nBUG FIXES\nGAMEPLAY\n\nFIXED \u2013 Issues with gadget deployment and consistency when interacting with

Electric damage and the minimum 50 damage threshold will trigger the minimum strength guard break animation.\nMelee damage, concussion FX, sonic bursts, and explosions of 100 damage or higher will trigger the the maximum strength guard break animation.\nOperators positioned behind a Clash, Monty, Blitz, or Fuze are now also partially protected from explosion damage (this still applies even if they are from the opposing team).
